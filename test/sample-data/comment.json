     "content": "The goal of the project is to design a 3D scanner that can digitize real world objects to sub millimeter resolution. Our project is divided into three phases. The first phase deals with the calibration of our camera and laser assembly and conversion from camera co-ordinates into real world co-ordinates. The calibration process will include triangulation using lookup tables and linear or spline interpolation. Phase two involves installing our sensors onto the scanning robot to map a sequence of 2D images into a 3D volume. The final phase will be texturing, rendering and possibly adding color if time permits. \n\n \t There is a need for an open source 3D scanning system. Most of the scanners available on the market are closed source systems which forces the user to rely on given specifications. So for this project our main motivation is to create an industry standard 3D scanner with known and open source implementations. The system will be designed to implement abstraction of devices so that external users are free to choose their own hardware. Another motivation is our desire to gain more knowledge and insight into the world of computer vision.",
